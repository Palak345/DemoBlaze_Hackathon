## 📌 **Project Overview**

The **DemoBlaze E-Commerce Testing Project** focuses on ensuring the functionality, reliability, and scalability of the DemoBlaze online store through a **comprehensive test automation and manual testing framework**. The project covers key aspects such as **UI automation, API testing, manual verification, and behavior-driven development (BDD)**. It employs industry-standard testing tools and methodologies to validate core features like **user authentication, product browsing, cart operations, and checkout process**.

## 🛠 **Tools and Technologies**

### 🔹 **Automation Testing (UI & Functional)**
- **Selenium WebDriver** – Automates web application interactions.
- **Java** – Primary programming language for test script development.
- **Cucumber (BDD)** – Defines test scenarios using Gherkin syntax.
- **Page Object Model (POM)** – Design pattern for maintainable test automation.

### 🔹 **API Testing**
- **Postman** – For API request validation and response verification.
- **REST Assured** – Java-based framework for API automation.

### 🔹 **Manual Testing**
- **Functional Testing** – Ensures that all features behave as expected.
- **Cross-Browser & Responsive Testing** – Validates the application across different browsers and devices.
- **UI/UX Testing** – Evaluates user experience and interface consistency.

### 🔹 **Build, Execution & Reporting**
- **Maven** – Manages dependencies and builds the automation project.
- **JUnit** – Executes and organizes test cases.
- **Extent Reports** – Generates detailed test execution reports.

### 🔹 **Version Control & Collaboration**
- **GitHub** – Manages source code, version control, and collaboration.

## ✅ **Features Tested**

### **1. UI Automation Testing**
- **Login & Authentication** – Validates correct login/logout flows.
- **Product Catalog** – Ensures accurate product listing and details.
- **Cart & Checkout** – Tests adding items, modifying cart, and order placement.
- **Error Handling & Alerts** – Verifies invalid inputs and security alerts.

### **2. API Testing**
- **User Authentication API** – Ensures login/logout API responses are correct.
- **Product Retrieval API** – Validates product listing and filtering capabilities.
- **Order Processing API** – Tests order placement and payment API integrity.

### **3. Manual Testing**
- **UI Responsiveness & Compatibility** – Tests the UI on various devices.
- **Functional Testing of Complex Workflows** – Validates user scenarios manually.
- **Edge Cases & Exploratory Testing** – Identifies bugs beyond automation coverage.
